Easily create a web server to keep your node app alive in platforms like repl.it

Usage:
```js
require('./keep-alive-replit').listen(80);
```

Then, just add the URL of your project to [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) or other similar project, like so: 
```
https://your-rep.your-name.repl.co/keep-alive
```
